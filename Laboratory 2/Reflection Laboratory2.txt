I searched for resume headers as inspiration and the slanting lines seemed to catch my interest. In choosing my palette, I went with my favorite color. dark green, and dark and light colors for contrast. The most challenging part in creating the logo is conceptualizing and choosing the perfect elements for it. I don't really have anything in mind as to how I'm going to use this branding but if I need it, I will surely go back to it.
