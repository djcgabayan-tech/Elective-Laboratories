The Easiest design was the banner because I already had a previous banner and used it as some kind of template for laboratory 3 activity. I applied branding elements by maintaining color and the vibe of the design. I ensured readability by making sure that the text pop out of the background using contrast. In creating social media graphics, it has to he eye-catching, scroll stopper if you will. However, I am not confident that my designs are scroll stoppers but it doesn't hurt to try.
