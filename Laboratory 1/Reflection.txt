I used the design principle of contrast. I applied this by adding shadows to the text to give it some contrast on the background to make it pop out. Along with this, I added a translucent text box to separate the text from the background. Moving elements of the background was easiest in using Canva, conceptualizing a design and finding the right elements to use was the hardest. I learned that visual communication aids the all in all delivery of the message you're trying to communicate, making it more appealing and engaging.
